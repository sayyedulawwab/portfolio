# Integrating Vertical Slice Architecture - A Practical Approach

## Introduction

As software projects scale, maintainability and modularity become critical. Recently, I integrated **Vertical Slice Architecture** into my Ecommerce Microservices solution to better organize my codebase around business use cases. This article shares my thought process, the decisions I made, and why I believe this approach enhances scalability and productivity.

## What is Vertical Slice Architecture?update

Vertical Slice Architecture organizes code around features or use cases rather than technical layers. Each feature becomes a self-contained unit, housing everything required to execute that functionality.

## Why I Made the Change

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Features are now isolated, making changes easier and less risky.
2. **Aligned with Business Use Cases**: The structure reflects real-world scenarios, enhancing clarity for developers.
3. **Scalability**: Each feature grows independently, supporting large-scale systems and teams.

## My Implementation

Hereâ€™s how I applied Vertical Slice Architecture to my solution:

### Application Project Reorganization

The Application project is now organized by **features**, with each feature folder containing:

- Command and Query objects
- Handlers for business logic
- Validators for input validation
- Additional files as needed

For example:

![Catalog Application Vertical Slice](./attachments/catalog-application-vertical-slice-6764394291786.webp)

### API Project Reorganization

The API project mirrors the Application project, with feature-based folders. Each folder contains a controller managing a single endpoint.

For example:

![Catalog API Vertical Slice](./attachments/catalog-api-vertical-slice-67643942a1767.webp)

### Controllers vs. Minimal APIs

I considered using Minimal APIs for endpoint definitions but chose controllers for now for these reasons:

- Minimal APIs require additional code to register endpoints in `Program.cs`.
- While tools like FastEndpoints simplify this, I avoided adding dependencies since controllers are sufficient for the requirements.
- Moving to Minimal APIs would require rewriting all the existing endpoints in controllers.

Of these three points, the third reason was the main deciding factor. However, when creating a new service with new features, Minimal APIs can be considered.

## Outcome and Benefits

This reorganization resulted in:

- Clear boundaries between features.
- Easier testing and debugging, as features are self-contained.
- Greater team productivity by reducing cross-feature dependencies.

## Conclusion

Integrating Vertical Slice Architecture into my solution simplifies feature development, aligns with real-world scenarios, and makes scaling easier. There is a common misconception about choosing between Clean Architecture and Vertical Slice Architecture. However, Clean Architecture also emphasizes use cases, which aligns perfectly with the main concept of Vertical Slice Architecture. Both approaches can coexist and complement each other, as demonstrated in my solution.
